# Probe: Intelligent Browsing Extension 

Probe is a browser extension for Google Chrome that summarizes any open webpage that is primarily text-based, such as a news article, encyclopedia entry, or blog post. It displays the primary sentences and topics of the page.

### Automatic Summarization
- When visiting a webpage with substantial text content (e.g., news articles, blog posts), the Probe icon (sigma symbol) appears in the bottom-right corner.
- Hover over the Probe icon to view the summary, which includes:
  - **Official Description:** Meta data description from the page.
  - **Topics (Word Clusters):** Most frequent word combinations.
  - **Summary (Key Sentences):** Relevant sentences ordered by importance.
